        the social media site may connect personal information that you may have
        provided to that social media site with information regarding your

        those comments and may retain that information indefinitely, however the
        website owner will delete any personal information provided with that
        feedback or comment, unless the website owner requires the personal
        information for another purpose and will then maintain such information
        for as long as needed for that other purpose. 3. How We Use Your
        Personal Information and Technical Information The Website Owner uses
        your personal information and technical information to: ● Complete your

        other entities that process payment transactions or other financial

        about promotional offers, sweepstakes, and surveys offered by or on

        combined with personal information obtained through other sources,
        including social media sources. We will ask for your consent before
        using your information for any purpose not set out in this Privacy
        Policy. 4. Disclosing Personal Information We may disclose your personal
        information in connection with a financial audit, law enforcement,
        national security, fraud prevention, or other legal action (such as a
        subpoena or court order); as required by law or regulation; or if the
        website owner reasonably believes it is necessary to protect itself, its
        customers or the public. In addition, we may share your personal
        information with business partners that help the website owner to carry
        out transactions you request or that help the website owner to

        your personal information with our business partners to help make our
        business or that of our business partners’ more responsive to your
        needs. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose
        your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes
        unless you have provided consent. As we continue to develop our
        business, we might sell or buy products, subsidiaries, or business
        units. In such transactions, personal information may be reviewed as
        part of the business due diligence and generally is one of the
        transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in
        any pre-existing privacy policy (unless, of course, you consent
        otherwise). Also, in the event that Homeosetu, or some or all of its
        assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the
        transferred assets. Some Homeosetu services are provided by business
        partners that may be located in different countries than Homeosetu or
        than where you are calling from. When you purchase support services from
        the website owner, we may provide your personal information along with
        technical information to our business partners in order to provide the
        support services you request. 5. Your Choices 5.1 Updating your

        this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone
        you should always log out before leaving a website or service to protect
        access to your information from subsequent users. 7. Collection and Use
        of Children’s Personal Information The Website Owner takes children’s
        privacy seriously. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
        children under the age of 16 through our websites. If you are under 18

        Technology The Homeosetu website and our business partners’ websites use
        “cookies” and similar tracking technologies (such as web beacons, tags,
        scripts and device identifiers). We may receive reports from business
        partners based on use of these technologies. These reports may provide
        this information on an individual as well as on an aggregated basis.
        Aggregate information is anonymous and may include demographic, usage,
        and sales information. 8.1 Cookies A cookie is a text file that is
        either stored in your computer’s memory temporarily and automatically
        deleted when you close your browser (a session cookie) or placed on your
        hard drive (a persistent cookie) by a web page server. A persistent
        cookie is not deleted when the browser is closed. The Website Owner uses
        both session cookies and persistent cookies. While The Website owner’s
        cookies do not save any personal information, they do save the serial
        number of any product licenses, which can be connected to your personal
        information such as email address, billing address and IP address. You
        have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
        automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
        setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Please refer to your web
        browser for more information. If you choose to decline cookies, you may
        not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of homeosetu
        website and services that depend on cookies. We use cookies to: ● save
        your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save
        you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same
        information; ● improve our websites; ● display personalized (targeted)
        content and appropriate Homeosetu software LLP’s product offerings on
        your later visits to our websites and to our partners’ and affiliates’
        websites; ● allow you to sign in to our services and to help personalize
        and customize your online experience; ● gather demographic information
        about our users; ● offer our products and services to you; ● tailor
        product discounts and purchase links; ● monitor the success of marketing
        programs; ● provide analytics regarding the use of our website, products
        and services; and ● provide security to attempt to identify and prevent
        fraud. Because the website owner relies on third-party advertising
        networks who may track you across websites over time for advertising
        purposes, we are not able to respond to your selection of the “Do Not
        Track”” option provided by your browser. We cannot advise on whether
        your selection of “Do Not Track” option will have any effect on the
        collection of cookie information by the third-parties who collect such
        cookie information on our websites. 8.2 Web Beacons A “web beacon” is an
        electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer
        when you view a web page or email. Our business partners use web beacons
        on our websites, in our emails, in our advertisements on other websites
        (including social media), and in our advertisements contained in third
        party emails sent to you. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness
        of our websites and our advertising in various ways for example, by
        counting the number of individuals who visit our websites from a
        particular advertisement or who make a purchase from our websites after
        viewing a particular advertisement as well as by telling us when a web
        page is viewed and providing a description of the page where the web
        beacon is placed. Web beacons also help us measure the effectiveness of
        our email campaigns, for example, by counting the number of individuals
        who open or act upon an email message, determining when an email message
        is opened and determining how many times an email message is forwarded.
        This helps us send more relevant advertisements to our users and on the
        websites most visited by you. Unlike cookies, you cannot decline web
        beacons. However, setting your browser to decline cookies may help
        prevent web beacons tracking your activity. 8.3 Analytic Tools We may
        use tools such as Google Analytics to better understand who is using our
        websites and how they are using them. These tools may use cookies and
        web beacons to save and collect information such as time of visit, pages
        visited, time spent on each page of the website, IP address, and type of
        operating system used. We may use this information to manage and improve
        our websites and to improve your experience with our websites. You can
        learn how to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking software at this
        website: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout 9. Third-Party Websites
        and Services Please be aware that other websites that you may access
        through our websites or from which you access our websites may collect
        personal information about you. The information practices of those
        third-party websites linked to or from homeosetu.com are not covered by
        this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that, in providing services on the
        website owner’s behalf, our business partners may collect personal
        information about you. 10. Retention, Storing and Transfer of Personal
        Information We will maintain your personal information for a period of
        two years from your last contact with us, unless we need to maintain it
        longer to comply with legal, tax, audit or other reporting requirements,
        and for the detection and prevention of fraud or other unlawful
        behavior. Personal information collected may be stored and processed in
        the India or any other country in which Homeosetu or its business
        partners maintain facilities, and these countries may have laws that are
        different from those of your country of residence. By using
        Homeosetu.com ‘s products and services, you consent to any such transfer
        of information outside of your country. 11. Changes to Our Privacy
        Policy Regarding Customer and Online User Information We will
        occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we post changes to this
        Privacy Policy, we will revise the Effective Date at the beginning of
        this policy. If there are material changes to this Privacy Policy or in
        how the website owner will use your personal information, we will notify
        you by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to
